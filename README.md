# Dodge-Game
The aim of this project is to build a game, named as “DodgeGame” using
 Tkinter. The game begins with the ball descending down, which we can strike up in any 
 random direction and hence it will again come down until and unless we miss it and it
 goes down. At the end of the game the score is displayed and the screen disappears by
 itself.
